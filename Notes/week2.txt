-change behaviour of a command:
like clang: an open source to compiple 
eg: for file: hello.c, clang hello.c provides a file ./a.out
the command can be modifies as clang -o hello hello.c
This says: -o for output
so, output hello when hello.c is compiled, 
so file created is ./hello which is better to know which file belongs to hello.c

- Steps of compiling:
preprocessing : preprocessing directives as in (#)include: adds the library functions to the program
compiling : translated from one language to assembly code, language understood by cpu
assembling : convert assembly code to binary 0 & 1's for computer to understand
linking : linking all the files in code: eg
        hello.c cs50.c stdio.h comes together to form full program
