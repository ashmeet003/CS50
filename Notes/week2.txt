-change behaviour of a command:
like clang: an open source to compiple 
eg: for file: hello.c, clang hello.c provides a file ./a.out
the command can be modifies as clang -o hello hello.c
This says: -o for output
so, output hello when hello.c is compiled, 
so file created is ./hello which is better to know which file belongs to hello.c

- Steps of compiling:
preprocessing : preprocessing directives as in (#)include: adds the library functions to the program
compiling : translated from one language to assembly code, language understood by cpu
assembling : convert assembly code to binary 0 & 1's for computer to understand
linking : linking all the files in code: eg
        hello.c cs50.c stdio.h comes together to form full program

-string ends with space or 0, but to better represent its good to says it as /0
that's how variable keeps track to as where string ends or NUL value (single L: terminating character)

-Why int main as int return?
        because of exit cases. in case of error code numbers
        such as error code like 404 are returned in case of code failure
        Numbers are standardized as what could go wrong with the code
