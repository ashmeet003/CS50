-change behaviour of a command:
like clang: an open source to compiple 
eg: for file: hello.c, clang hello.c provides a file ./a.out
the command can be modifies as clang -o hello hello.c
This says: -o for output
so, output hello when hello.c is compiled, 
so file created is ./hello which is better to know which file belongs to hello.c
