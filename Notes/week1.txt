- Escape Sequences:
    - \n : next line
    - \r : beginning of the line
    - \" : to add double quote to text
    - \' : to add single quote to text
    - \\ : to add back-slash to text

- Header Files: gives access to libraries and language related functionalities
manual.cs50.io has the manual for header files

-command prompts:
    - cd : change directory
    - cp : copy
    - ls : list files
    - mkdir : make directory
    - mv : move /rename  [eg: mv hello.c hello : moves hello.c file to hello folder]
    - rm : remove
    - rmdir : remove directory

-Get user input in c:
    - use scanf() also available in <stdio.h> to get input.
        - it uses : %s, %d, and more for taking inputs
        - add extra space " %c" before c for since there is an extra space already present causing the scanf to skip the letter

-Truncation: process where computer changes float value to int because variable number stored in is int
    eg: int x; x=1/2 (=1.5 but answer is 1)
    To avoid this we can use : parsing
    printf("%f", (float)x/y)
    printf("%.5f", (float)x/y) : takes floating number to 5 digit: 0.0000
    
-Macros: are used to define numbers like constant to avoid variable manipulation
    like: #define COURSE 2
          #define AGE 22
          #define NAME "Ashmeet"

question: why c is fastest?
    : direct mapping to machine instructions and its compiled nature, which allows for optimized execution.
      Unlike interpreted languages like Python or Java, C compiles directly to machine code, enabling faster 
      execution because there's no intermediate layer of interpretation or bytecode execution.
